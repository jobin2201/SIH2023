About
Mental health is a fundamental aspect of overall well-being, and it often goes unnoticed. The Ministry of Gujarat recognizes the importance of mental health, especially in the context of fitness and sports. This project's goal is to create a user-friendly web application that allows individuals to self-identify their mental status, providing a safe and anonymous space for self-reflection.

The key features of this application include:

Mental Health Assessment: Users can take self-assessment quizzes to gauge their mental well-being in various aspects.

Resource Hub: Access to a comprehensive resource hub containing articles, videos, and tips related to mental health, fitness, and sports.

Expert Guidance: Users can seek guidance from mental health experts and fitness trainers through live chat or scheduled appointments.

Community Support: A supportive online community where users can share their experiences and offer support to others.
