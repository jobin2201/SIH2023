#### 3. Frequency Healing
Music has long been recognized for its profound impact on human emotions and mental states. It can evoke a wide range of feelings, from joy and relaxation to introspection and even catharsis. Importantly, music has the potential to reduce stress, alleviate pain, and contribute to overall well-being. Our project incorporates a sophisticated system designed to analyze users' emotional states. It does this by examining various physiological and psychological indicators, such as heart rate, stress level and self-reported mood. By collecting data on these parameters, the system gains insights into the user's current emotional and mental condition.<br><br>
Frequency Healing: Within our project, we've implemented a concept known as "Frequency Healing." This approach involves playing music at a specific frequency, in this case, 174 Hertz. This frequency is chosen for its known potential to provide relief from pain and stress. It's based on the idea that specific frequencies can resonate with the body and mind, leading to positive physiological and psychological responses.<br><br>
- Advanced Analysis with Librosa: To make Frequency Healing effective, we utilize the advanced capabilities of a library called Librosa. Librosa is a Python package designed for music and audio analysis. It allows us to extract valuable information from audio signals, including features related to pitch, rhythm, and timbre. These features are essential for understanding the emotional content of music.
- Bidirectional LSTM: In addition to Librosa, we implement Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for its ability to analyze sequences of data. Bidirectional LSTMs enhance this capability by processing data in both forward and backward directions. In our project, they help in the in-depth analysis of users' emotional states over time.<br>
