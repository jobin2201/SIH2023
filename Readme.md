# Self-Identifying Mental Status and Support Guidance

## Project Overview
In a world that increasingly prioritizes physical fitness and well-being, the importance of mental health often takes a back seat. However, the truth is that mental health concerns affect millions of individuals, and the need for support and guidance is greater than ever. The question that arises is, can technology bridge the gap between mental health and overall well-being? This is where our innovative project comes into play.

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Self-Identifying Mental Status and Support Guidance" project, developed as part of the Smart India Hackathon. This project aims to address the critical issue of mental health by leveraging technology to provide individuals with a platform for self-identifying their mental status and accessing guidance and support related to fitness and sports.

## Introducing HOPEAI
Introducing HOPE-AI, an Empathetic AI chatbot that is redefining the landscape of mental health support. It's not just about conversations; it's about understanding, empathy, and timely interventions. Our project recognizes that screening tools are the first step in identifying and addressing mental health issues. These tools are designed to assess an individual's mental state comprehensively. To achieve this, we have integrated the ICD-10 dataset, a globally recognized reference for diagnosing various health conditions, to provide a holistic understanding of medical conditions and their correlation with emotional well-being. Our mission is clear: to make mental well-being accessible to all.

At the core of our project is an intelligent chatbot, designed to be a friendly and supportive companion for users. The chatbot is equipped with advanced natural language processing capabilities, allowing it to engage in meaningful conversations with users. It serves as a virtual mental health assistant, guiding users through self-assessment quizzes and offering personalized recommendations based on their responses. The bot is programmed to provide empathetic responses and is available 24/7 to ensure users always have access to support.

## The App
To make our services easily accessible, we have developed a user-friendly web and mobile application. The app serves as a gateway to our mental health platform and provides several key features. Users can take self-assessment quizzes to gauge their mental well-being in various aspects, such as stress, anxiety, and depression. The app also features a comprehensive resource hub containing articles, videos, and tips related to mental health, fitness, and sports. Users can access valuable insights and guidance from mental health experts and fitness trainers through live chat or scheduled appointments. Additionally, the app hosts a supportive online community where users can share their experiences and offer support to others.

**App Name: HOPE** 

Our application, named HOPE, is a user-friendly and innovative platform that focuses on mental health, fitness, and sports. It provides individuals with a safe and anonymous space for self-reflection, mental health assessment, access to valuable resources, expert guidance, and a supportive online community.


## Integration of Bot with App
The integration of our intelligent chatbot with the app is a crucial element of our project. It ensures that users have a seamless and interactive experience while using the application. When users log in to the app, they are greeted by the chatbot, which initiates a conversation to understand the user's mental state and needs. The chatbot guides users through self-assessment quizzes, offering immediate feedback and recommendations. It can also schedule appointments with mental health experts or fitness trainers based on user preferences. The chatbot remains accessible throughout the user's journey, providing continuous support and assistance. This integration ensures that users have a personalized and responsive experience while using our mental health platform.

## The Impact
Our project aims to make mental health support more accessible, especially to those who are passionate about fitness and sports. By integrating mental health assessments, guidance, and resources into a fitness-oriented application, we hope to inspire individuals to prioritize their mental well-being. We believe that the synergy of mental health and physical fitness can lead to a happier and healthier society. Our chatbot's empathetic interactions and the app's comprehensive features are poised to make a positive impact on the lives of many, fostering a culture of self-awareness and mental well-being within the fitness and sports community.


## Technology Stack  Used:

**ReactJS:** We've harnessed the power of ReactJS, a popular JavaScript library, to create an interactive and user-friendly frontend for our app HOPE. ReactJS facilitates the development of dynamic, responsive web interfaces.

**Firebase:** Firebase serves as our backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform. It handles user authentication, real-time data synchronization, and hosting, ensuring that our application runs smoothly and securely.

**SQL Database:** For storing and managing user data, we've employed a SQL database. SQL databases are renowned for their reliability and scalability, making them a robust choice for handling user information securely.

**NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit):** NLTK is a Python library for natural language processing (NLP). We've integrated NLTK to empower Baymax or bot with text analysis capabilities, enabling it to understand and respond to user inputs effectively.

**TensorFlow:** TensorFlow, an open-source machine learning framework, plays a crucial role in our project. We've utilized it to develop machine learning models for sentiment analysis, emotion detection, and personalized recommendations.

**GTTs (gTTS - Google Text-to-Speech):** GTTs allows us to convert text-based responses generated by Baymax into natural-sounding speech. This text-to-speech conversion enhances user interactions and accessibility.

**ICD-10:** The International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition (ICD-10), serves as a foundation for our mental health assessment tools. It provides a standardized system for diagnosing mental health conditions.


### Machine Learning Algorithms

**Sentiment Analysis:** We've implemented sentiment analysis using machine learning to assess user mood and emotions based on text inputs. This helps us tailor Baymax's responses accordingly.

**Emotion Detection:** Leveraging machine learning, we've developed an emotion detection algorithm that identifies emotions in user text, allowing Baymax to offer empathetic and supportive responses.

### NLP Components:

**Tokenization:** NLTK's tokenization capabilities enable us to break down user inputs into individual words or tokens. This process aids in understanding user queries more effectively.

**Lemmatization:** NLTK's lemmatization function helps in reducing words to their base or root form. This ensures that Baymax comprehends variations of words, enhancing its ability to understand user messages.

## Front End & Back End 
**ReactJS and Firebase:**
ReactJS provides the foundation for our user-friendly and dynamic frontend. Firebase seamlessly integrates with ReactJS to manage user authentication, real-time data updates, and hosting. Together, they ensure a responsive and secure user experience.

**SQL Database:**
Our SQL database serves as a reliable and scalable storage solution for user data. It enables secure data management and retrieval, ensuring that user information is handled with care and precision.

**ICD-10 and Mental Health Professionals:**
We've incorporated ICD-10 coding standards into our mental health assessment tools to provide users with accurate and standardized results. Additionally, our application connects users with mental health professionals who can offer guidance and support based on the assessments.

**TensorFlow:**
TensorFlow powers our machine learning models, enabling Baymax to analyze user inputs and provide personalized recommendations for fitness and mental health activities. This enhances the overall user experience, making it more tailored to individual needs.

## Summary
Our project is a comprehensive and innovative approach to mental health and fitness. It combines the capabilities of ReactJS, Firebase, NLTK, TensorFlow, and more to create an empathetic virtual assistant, and a user-friendly application. The integration of these technologies ensures that users receive personalized support for their mental well-being while pursuing fitness and sports activities.
